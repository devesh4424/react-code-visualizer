# React Code Visualizer 💻✨

This project is an AI-powered frontend development assistant built with React and OpenAI's ChatGPT API. It allows users to input prompts related to React components or UI design. The application then fetches the code using the ChatGPT API and displays both the generated code and a live preview of the UI.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔮 Prompt-based React code generation using ChatGPT API
- 🧠 Displays the generated code (JSX, CSS, etc.)
- 🌐 Renders a live preview of the React component
- 💡 Easy to use UI for developers and learners

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React.js (Vite or CRA)
- OpenAI ChatGPT API
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- `react-live` or `react-preview` for live code rendering

## Demo
